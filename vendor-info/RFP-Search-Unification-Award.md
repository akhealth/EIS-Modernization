## RFP #180000022: Announcement of Award

In early November 2017, the State of Alaska’s Department of Health and Social Services [released the first](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/RFP-Search-Unification) in a series of RFPs to support the modernization of the state’s benefit eligibility systems. The release of an initial RFP for a unified search interface followed a period where draft solicitation documents were developed in the open on the code sharing platform Github, and [comments were solicited](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Vendor+feedback%22) from interested vendors.

A number of vendors with experience in agile, user-focused development practices submitted proposals in response to this initial RFP, and a Proposal Evaluation Committee (PEC) comprised of DHSS and 18F staff interviewed them over a period of two-weeks in early December. At the conclusion of this process, the PEC selected **Resource Data, Inc.** - an Alaska firm with experience in both agile practices and with past State of Alaska projects - to work on the unified search module. 

In the coming weeks, DHSS and 18F will be reaching out to vendors that asked questions during our RFP development process, or that expressed an interest, to learn more about their impressions of our process, and to keep them engaged for future RFPs. In addition, work is now underway to develop the next solicitation in this ongoing modernization effort.

Both the State of Alaska and 18F are excited about the quality and number of firms that expressed an interest during the initial RFP development, and encourage any firm interested in this work to monitor the [DHSS Github organization](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization) for future announcements, updates and outreach.
