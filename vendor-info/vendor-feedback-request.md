## Overview

The State of Alaska DHSS and 18F are reaching out to vendors that expressed an interest in the Alaska[ EIS modernization project](https://github.com/AlaskaDHSS/EIS-Modernization/blob/master/README.md) either by responding to the RFI, commenting on the draft RFP, or commenting on the final RFP.  We're interested in why some vendors may have decided not to submit a bid, and what adjustments we might make that would encourage you to bid in the future.

We ended up with some very good bids from some very good bidders, and we are very happy with our award decision. However, we always want to improve our interactions with companies that might be interested in supporting the important work the State of Alaska is doing. In addition, the we will soon be issuing additional RFPs to support the EIS modernization project. 

##  Request for feedback

We would appreciate if interested vendors would take a few moments to fill out [a very lightweight survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdustMAV7GzSNk1nmr_EKVt_E4e2pFcZOiyh1_l7rO4h_Rqkg/viewform) about what their experience was like for our first RFP, and perhaps some insights into your decision-making. Completing it shouldn’t take more than 2–5 minutes. This is not required in any way. 

We will update this repo with anonymized lessons learned after responses are received.
